# Volume Control Using Hand
This project involves using your index finger to increase or decrease your computer's volume. It uses the hand detection system in order to work. It is an intermediate type of project so you require some knowledge regarding python and modules beforehand and then you are good to go.

## Required Package(s)
Python Version Used: 3.8.10

numpy mediapipe cv2 pycaw
```bash
pip install numpy mediapipe cv2 pycaw
```

## Installation Guide
You need to download this repo and install the mentioned packages using `pip` above. A Webcam is strongly needed as it uses hand detection in order to work efficiently.

## Future Plans
Currently no future plans but there is a slight bug which needs to fixed, where the volume line on the screen doesn't go below 3.
